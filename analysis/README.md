Here we are trying to prepare data and finally run SubCell

# Data Selection

 Images in the `./data` folder was copied manually. but [data_transfer.sh](./data_transfer.sh) is a try to auto transfer the data. (but took too long for me)

# HPA-Cell-Segmentation Analysis

Generated by Rebecca: [HPA Cell SegmentationScript.ipynb](./HPACellSegmentationScript.ipynb) contains scripts to run HPA-Cell-Segmentation on the data.

Results are saved in "./segmetation_results2"

# Cell Segmentation by CellPose 

I am going to run an alternate approach of cell segmentation by [run_Cellpose-SAM.ipynb](./run_Cellpose-SAM.ipynb)
