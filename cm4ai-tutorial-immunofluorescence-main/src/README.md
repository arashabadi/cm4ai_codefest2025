### What this notebook is for
- **Purpose**: Exploratory data analysis for a 4‑channel immunofluorescence dataset. It indexes image files, parses RO‑Crate metadata to attach antibody/gene annotations, generates per‑treatment node-attribute TSVs for downstream graphs, computes basic image stats, and prints a human-readable summary with one diagnostic plot.

### Data assumptions and layout
- **Images**: `../data/raw/<treatment>/<channel>/*.jpg` where channels are `blue`, `green`, `red`, `yellow`.
- **Metadata**: Each treatment folder contains `ro-crate-metadata.json` describing images, stains/antibodies, cell lines, and treatments.

### Key steps (cell by cell)

- **Imports and constants**
  - Sets `BASE_PATH = "../data/raw"` and `CHANNELS = ["blue", "green", "red", "yellow"]`.

- **collect_image_paths()**
  - Scans treatment folders and channels, groups per‑image base IDs (e.g., `..._blue.jpg` → base ID without suffix).
  - Returns a wide DataFrame with columns: `id`, `treatment`, `blue`, `green`, `red`, `yellow` (paths).
  - Display immediately after shows only duplicated IDs; that view is empty by design (it filters to duplicates).

- **load_rocrate_metadata_with_antibodies()**
  - Reads each folder’s `ro-crate-metadata.json`.
  - Builds an antibody/stain index from `BioChemEntity` entries: name, description, HPA, ENSEMBL, UniProt, PubChem, subcellular location.
  - Iterates `EVI:Dataset` entries (each image), extracts:
    - `id` (base ID), `channel`, `stain_key`, `antibody_*` fields, `cell_line`, `treatment`, `description`, `filename`.
  - Returns a long metadata DataFrame keyed by `id` and `channel`.

- **batch_lookup_ensembl_symbols()**
  - Batched POST to Ensembl REST API to map Ensembl Gene IDs → gene symbols.
  - Used later to improve `name` fields in output TSVs.

- **save_image_gene_node_attributes(df_merged, base_output_dir)**
  - Filters to the protein‑target **green** channel.
  - Normalizes treatment: `control` → `untreated`; drops duplicates on (`id`, `treatment`, `antibody_hpa_id`, `antibody_ensembl`).
  - Creates a node-attributes table with:
    - `name` (later mapped from Ensembl), `represents` (`ensembl:<ID>`), `ambiguous` and `antibody` (HPA ID), `filename` (`<id>_`), `imageurl` placeholder.
  - Looks up Ensembl display names; fills missing names as `NEGATIVE`.
  - Writes one TSV per treatment: `../data/raw/<treatment>/1_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv`.
  - In your run: wrote files for `paclitaxel`, `untreated`, `vorinostat`.

- **load_multichannel_image(row)**
  - Loads the 4 grayscale JPGs by channel and stacks into an `H×W×4` NumPy array.

- **compute_stats_row() / compute_channel_stats_parallel()**
  - Per image: computes per‑channel mean, std, min, max.
  - Parallelized with `joblib` and a progress bar.
  - Used later for a diagnostic boxplot.

- **print_summary_report(df_merged)**
  - Prints:
    - Number of treatments and counts of image‑channel combinations.
    - Unique sample counts per treatment (`id` level).
    - Image size distribution: loads shapes in parallel; prints counts by `(H, W)`.
    - Green‑channel antibody diversity (unique HPA IDs).
    - Lists distinct antibodies/stains for red/blue/yellow.
  - Your run output:
    - Treatments: 3
    - Image‑channel counts: vorinostat 17848; paclitaxel 17684; control 15904
    - Unique samples: control 3976; paclitaxel 4421; vorinostat 4462
    - Image shapes: 2048×2048 for 12859 multichannel images
    - Green unique antibodies: 465
    - Red: Tubulin antibody; Blue: DAPI; Yellow: Calreticulin antibody

- **Execution flow**
  - `df_images = collect_image_paths()`
  - View duplicates by `id` (expected empty in display).
  - `df_meta = load_rocrate_metadata_with_antibodies()`
  - Melt `df_images` to long format, merge with `df_meta` on `["id", "channel"]` → `df_merged`.
  - `save_image_gene_node_attributes(df_merged, base_output_dir=BASE_PATH)` → writes TSVs.
  - `print_summary_report(df_merged)` → prints the dataset summary.
  - Compute per‑channel stats and show a seaborn boxplot of mean intensity by treatment.

### What it produces
- **Files**: `../data/raw/<treatment>/1_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv` (for graph/node ingestion).
- **Console outputs**: Dataset summary (counts, sizes, antibody diversity).
- **Plot**: Boxplot of mean channel intensity by treatment.

### In short
- It indexes images, enriches them with RO‑Crate antibody/gene metadata, writes per‑treatment node attribute TSVs keyed by Ensembl, computes basic image statistics, and summarizes the dataset structure and content.

- Generated TSVs in your run:
  - `../data/raw/paclitaxel/1_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv`
  - `../data/raw/untreated/1_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv`
  - `../data/raw/vorinostat/1_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv`

- Summary highlights from your run:
  - 3 treatments, 2048×2048 images, 12.8k multichannel composites
  - 465 unique green-channel antibodies
  - Channel stains: Red=Tubulin, Blue=DAPI, Yellow=Calreticulin
